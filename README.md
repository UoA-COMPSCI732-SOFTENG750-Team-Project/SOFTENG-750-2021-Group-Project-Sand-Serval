<br><br>


This is an web app developed by [Wilson](https://github.com/WilsonBaker), [Tudor](https://github.com/PisuCat), [Quang](https://github.com/femmon) and [James](https://github.com/jameszu) in SOFTENG 750/COMPSCI 732 course at the University of Auckland. <br><br>

~~Check out our live demo [here](https://ssscheduler.netlify.app/)~~<br>
## Important Note for the live site:
It is working but only for the frontend, we haven't set up the backend to the server so the frontend will NOT work, run the following command to check on your local machine. 

# How to start the frontend

### Make sure npm, nodejs are installed

<br>
Go to termial, make sure you are at root folder<br>
Run follwing commands <br>

Note if your npm version is 7+ then run npm update, otherwise you could ignore that for the time sake<br>
```
cd sss_frontend
npm install 
npm update
npm start
```

Then there should be localhost coming up and test it out!

# How to start the backend

### Make sure npm, nodejs, and mongoDb are installed

<br>
Go to termial, make sure you are at root folder. <br>
Run follwing commands <br>

```
cd sss_backend
npm install
npm run start
```
Then you will see the server is listening on port 3001ÔºÅ
