## Important Note for the live site:
Only the frontend is working, we haven't set up the backend to the server so the live page will NOT work, it is only used to display the home page for now. <br>
Run the following command to check on your local machine. 

## Another important NOTE
This is designed for multiple users, so if you want to test our locally, please use different browser for differnt users. (Cookie issues)<br>
Possible ways: open up 4 windows, they are a chrome tab, incognito chrome tab, MS Edge tab, MS Edge incognito tab, and etc...


<br><br>

# How to start the backend

### Make sure npm, NodeJs, and MongoDB are installed

<br>
Go to termial, make sure you are at root folder. <br>
Run follwing commands <br>

```
cd sss_backend
npm install

```
Then you will see the server is listening on port 3001ÔºÅ

# Known issue
If you open the link with mobile, choose some event and close your phone for around 10 second, the frontend will crash for unknown reason. So please close the tab on the mobile one you are not using it. With some investigation, it might casued by the socket connection which we cannot fix for now : (
<br>

# Sprint planning and retro
We sort of used the scrum methodology for our project, where all of us sit down, discuss the issues and male them as story points, you can see the porject board with this link<br>

Besides, we have our [meeting minutes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S729zHs9FiUQpICKNURghnnr4JKvFXTF/view?usp=sharing) for the project, although it is written after we realised we need to include them <br>
